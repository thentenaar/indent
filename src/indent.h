/** Values that `indent' can return for exit status.
 *
 *  `total_success' means no errors or warnings were found during a successful
 *    invocation of the program.
 *
 *  `invocation_error' is returned if an invocation problem (like an incorrect
 *    option) prevents any formatting to occur.
 *
 *  `indent_error' is returned if errors occur during formatting which
 *    do not prevent completion of the formatting, but which appear to be
 *    manifested by incorrect code (i.e, code which wouldn't compile).
 *
 *  `indent_punt' is returned if formatting of a file is halted because of
 *    an error with the file which prevents completion of formatting.  If more
 *    than one input file was specified, indent continues to the next file.
 *
 *  `indent_fatal' is returned if a serious internal problem occurs and
 *    the entire indent process is terminated, even if all specified files
