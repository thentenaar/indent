	* Use want_blank instead of copying a space to e_code to avoid
	  double spaces.
	* Fix print_comment reading past the end of the buffer when reading
	 less than a full comment from stdin.
	* Ensure that there's only one point where exit(3) is used.
	* Add xfree() to globs.
	* xfree() common heap-allocated storage.
	* Fixed some memory leaks in the profile stuff.
	* Be sure to initialize the two automatic storage buffers used in
	  scan_profile(). This fixes a warnings from valgrind.

	* Added -par to -kr.
	* Fixed detection of struct initializer lists as block_init.
	* Added an option (-sar/--spaces-around-initializers) to add a space
	  after the lbrace and before the rbrace of struct initializers.

2015-06-14 Tim Hentenaar <tim@hentenaar.com>
	* Added an option (-as/--align-with-spaces) which if indenting with
	  tabs will ident to the current indentation level, and then pad
	  with spces up till the target_column.
	* If -npcs is set, don't add a space between a function pointer's
	  name and its arglist.
	* Fix indentation of block comments following braces.

    * Fix regression introduced in hg revision 25c27d429590
	* Add an option (-slc/--single-line-conditionals) to allow
	  conditionals and their inner statement to be on the same line if
	  they're not braced. This should fix GNU bug #42357.
	* Added a small patch to add size_t, wchar_t and ptrdiff_t to
	  user_specials automatically.

2014-04-07  Andrew Shadura  <andrew@shadura.me>
	* Don't add extra 'const' keyword to C++ programs (closes Debian bugs
	  #507173 and #349065).

2014-03-29 Daniel P. Valentine <dpv@world.std.com>
        * Added option -gts to treat _("...") and N_("...") as strings rather than
          functions with string arguments. (args.c, indent.h, lexi.c, indent.texi,
          regression/input/gettext-strings.c)

2014-03-29  Andrew Shadura  <andrew@shadura.me>
	* Add an option to fix nested comments (-fnc/--fix-nested-comment).
	  This option which tries to fix nested comments by replacing '/*'
	  inside comments by a space followed by '*'. By default, this option
	  is turned off.
	* Pass -npro to indent when running tests.

	* Adjusted a couple of warnings from automake (.texinfo->.texi; AM_CPPFLAGS->INCLUDES)

2010-01-31  David Ingamells  <indent@isidore-it.eu>
	* Fixed Debian Bug report logs - #485764, Regression with --blank-lines-after-declarations in 2.2.10

	   preprocessor-statements with n spaces per level.  Overrides -lps.

2002-08-25  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* Added option break-function-decl-args-end
	  (bfde) to break the function arguments list before the closing bracket.
	* -bdfa now causes a break after the opening bracket and before the first
	  argument so that the first argument and subsequent arguments are indented

2002-08-05  Matthias <moh@itec.uni-klu.ac.at> and Eric Lloyd <ewlloyd@neta.com>
	 * Added support for -brf to place function opening brace after function
	 * declaration.

2002-03-14  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* args.c : fixed handling of comments in the profile file.
	* args.c : profile file can also be specified by the environment variable INDENT_PROFILE
	* io.c output.c : extracted output code from io.c and put it in output.c

2002-02-26  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* comments.c : reduced problems with -st and repeated calls. Still a bug when 2
	  comments on one line.

2002-01-22  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* indent.h : hopefully reduced problems when building without the gettext library.

2002-01-22  Charles Lecklider  <charles@invis.co.uk>
	* config.h.watcom makefile.watcom.in : Added files for use with Watcom compiler.

2002-01-17  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* io.c : Files will now always get a newline at the end of file if the input was missing
	  one. This now matches the default behaviour of vi.
	* args.c : Parameterised argument lists for gnu, kr and orig setting sets.

2002-01-17  Carlo Wood  <carlo@alinoe.com>
	* texinfo2man.c : Fixed handling of @@ within a @email{}. Now only one @ is output.

2002-01-08  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* configure.ac : Fixed problems of autoconf items used by gettext being defined instead
	  of just "required". This should fix problems with a missing stpcpy during build.
	* automake.am : fixed order that directories are listed. This ensure that the intl directory
	  is built before the indent executable.
	* Added the I18N files that have been delivered by the translation team. There are
	  now 15 languages supported in addition the coded English messages.
	* po/* : Added 15 .po files from the I18N team.
	* src/indent.h : Fixed include of the gettext include file. (removed "intl/")
	* src/indent.c : Fixed problem in multi-file mode where input file is truncated if
	  the backup file exists and is write protected.

2001-12-04  John Bridges  <indent@peekpoke.com>
	* indent.dsp, wildcard.c : improvements for vc++.

2001-12-04  Vladislav Naumov  <vnaum@echo.ru>

	* miscel/config.h.vc++ : prevent UTIME for mingw32.

2001-11-27  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>
	* makefile.am,*/makefile.am : Major changes to the Makefile.am files to reflect the new
	  deep structure and to come closer to the current auto-tool styles.

2001-11-02  David Ingamells  <indent@dingamells.fsnet.co.uk>

	* general : Changing over to 'deep' release structure with src, doc, etc. directories. This
	  is requiring a major revamp of the "auto" tool input files.

	* lexi.c : Allowed a string to be multi-line (i.e. newlines from code file is part of string).

	* all_source_files : ANSI-ize all functions and clean-up layout. Break up some too-big functions.
